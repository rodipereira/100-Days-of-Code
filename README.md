# Band Name Generator
This is a simple Python project that generates a fun and creative band name based on user input. 
The program asks the user for the name of their birth city and their pet's name, then combines the two to suggest a unique band name. 
It's a great starting point for learning how to work with user input and string manipulation in Python.
